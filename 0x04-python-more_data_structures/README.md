In Python, the "more_data_structures" refers to additional data structures beyond the basic ones like lists, tuples, and dictionaries. These additional data structures provide specialized ways of organizing and manipulating data. Here are some commonly used ones:

Sets: Sets are unordered collections of unique elements. They are useful for operations like checking membership, removing duplicates, and performing mathematical set operations such as union, intersection, and difference.

Namedtuples: Namedtuples are similar to tuples but have named fields accessible using dot notation. They provide a convenient way to define lightweight data structures with named attributes.

Counter: Counter is a dictionary subclass provided by Python's collections module. It is used to count the frequency of elements in a list or any other iterable. It can be particularly handy for tasks like counting occurrences of elements.

defaultdict: defaultdict is another dictionary subclass from the collections module. It provides a default value for keys that are not present in the dictionary, eliminating the need for explicit checks and handling of missing keys.

OrderedDict: OrderedDict is a dictionary subclass that maintains the order of insertion of keys. It remembers the order in which the keys were added, allowing you to iterate over the keys or entries in a predictable order.

deque: deque (pronounced "deck") stands for "double-ended queue." It is a generalization of stacks and queues. Deques support efficient appends and pops from both ends and can be used for tasks that require fast insertions and removals at both ends.
