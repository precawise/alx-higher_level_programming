f-else statement:

The if-else statement allows you to execute different blocks of code based on a condition.
It starts with the "if" keyword followed by a condition.
If the condition is True, the code inside the if block is executed.
If the condition is False, the code inside the else block is executed.
elif statement (else if):

The elif statement is used to chain multiple conditions together.
It comes after an if statement and before an optional else statement.
It allows you to check additional conditions if the previous conditions are False.
You can have multiple elif statements to handle different cases.
Here's the general flow of execution for if-else and elif statements:

The condition of the if statement is evaluated.
If the condition is True, the code inside the if block is executed.
If the condition is False, the program proceeds to the next elif statement (if any) and evaluates its condition.
If the condition in an elif statement is True, the code inside that elif block is executed.
If none of the if or elif conditions are True, the program executes the code inside the else block (if present).
After executing the code block corresponding to the first True condition, the program exits the if-elif-else structure.
The if-else and elif statements provide flexibility in controlling the flow of your program based on different conditions. They allow you to handle various scenarios and make decisions dynamically during runtime.
